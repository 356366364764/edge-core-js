# Airbitz Javascript core

Run `npm install` to get the dependencies you need,
then run 'npm test' to run the tests.

To build for the web, run `npm run webpack`

Until Airbitz makes the auth server available without special certificates,
running the live unit tests requires:

    export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0

The live unit tests are disabled for now.

All sources are in the [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com/) style.
